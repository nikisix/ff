[[ Requirements ]]
Stock python should be enough. If you encounter bugs, make sure your python installation includes the imports used.
Still trying to figure out the install script..Thinking about an alias or bash function in the .bashrc.. 
Any pointers appreciated

[[ Installation ]]
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikisix/ff/master/install.sh
bash install.sh
source .bashrc
(or source .bash_profile if osx is our thing, change the install.sh script to write there instead of .bashrc ofc)

Note: this script assumes that you have a .bashrc, if you're on osx you probably have a .bash_profile. Simply
change install.sh line to from .bashrc -> .bash_profile and you should be fine

[[ Execution ]]
. ff.sh

Note that we use the "dot" operator here to run the program in the current process rather than in a subprocess with 
which would happen with something like: "sh ff.sh"

[[ TODO ]]
Separate or color files and directories different colors
Organize files and dirs into columns instead of just a list
Jedi-mode - no help message/title
