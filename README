Still trying to figure out the install script..Thinking about an alias or bash function in the .bashrc.. 
Any pointers appreciated

[[ Execution ]]
. ff.sh

Note that we use the "dot" operator here to run the program in the current process rather than in a subprocess with 
which would happen with something like: "sh ff.sh"
